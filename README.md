# BadgeMaker
ID / Badge Maker for events


#One Hour Project
For JUGBD Meetup 5.0, we had to make some badge for the visitors. I looked up on the internet for this kind of badge making in a lot, but couldn't found a free one. There are nearly eighty visitors, and to lessen the manual work of making the badges customized for each attendee, we made this simple application. This will take attendee information from an excel file and make a pdf file containing a preformatted badge for every attendees.

#Goal
Currently the code of this project may seem like garbage. But once I get time(!), I will clean the codes and make it modular so that other can also add their desired feature.
